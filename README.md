# Randomized-SVD

This GitHub repository documents work completed by the Randomized SVD team at [Summer@ICERM 2020](https://icerm.brown.edu/summerug/2020/). The authors of the code provided here are David Melendez, Jennifer Zheng, and Katie Keegan. As the tasks that we each completed were often distinct and requiring different functions, our code is organized based on the person. 

The below information should help clarify how to reproduce specific results, which have been documented in two written reports: our [report for Summer@ICERM]() as well as a [submitted manuscript for SIURO]().
